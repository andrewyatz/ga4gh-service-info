## Updating the specifications

Minor editorial fixes where there is no likelihood of controversy may be done directly on the **master** branch. Larger changes should be proposed as pull requests so that they can be discussed and refined. 

Even those with write access to the **ga4gh-discovery/ga4gh-service-info** repository should in general create their pull request branches within their own **ga4gh-service-info** forks. This way when the main repository is forked again, the new fork is created with a minimum of extraneous volatile branches.

## Documents to update

Service-info's main specification document is the [service-info.yaml OpenAPI document](service-info.yaml). In addition, [service-info's README.md](README.md) contains higher level information about the specification and must be kept in-line with changes to the OpenAPI document.
